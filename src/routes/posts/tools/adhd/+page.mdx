I procrastinated today. Or maybe yesterday; I can't be sure. Days sometime bleed together. My alarm clock blares at 8am but hitting snooze is so tempting...okay, not really. I'm pretty good at waking up right as the alarm rings. I roam around, make coffee, check Slack, watch some Youtube. It's 11am now. I plan to head down to one of the local coffee places. Ughh, I need to do laundry; but not today. I reach the coffee shop and get in line. I'm thinking that I should try cold brew; never had that before. The waitress takes my order. I sit down with my computer and a cup of hot mocha. Don't feel like having mocha today. There's a lot I have to do today. I write down some things I'll get done today both in Slack and my notes app. One of those things will have some progress. I need to finish Task A today, only have an hour of work left on it. I'm focused. I'm getting a lot of work done. Task B is 90% done, 2 days ahead of schedule. 

It happens. I sometimes struggle with time blindness. In other words, estimating how much time has passed or how much time some thing might take is hit or miss. Mostly miss. If I have to meet a friend at 4pm, it's likely I'll leave my house at 3:40pm somehow pretending I'll complete a 30 minute commute in 20 minutes. It's 3:50pm and I'm about to leave my house. I haven't had this happen often but starting tasks can be difficult. It usually depends on how much I don't want to do that particular task. Mostly I'll delay it by a day or max a week. Except for once or twice where timelines slipped but around 3 months. I enjoy hyperfocus now that I am much better at pacing myself on what to hyperfocus on. I used to often discover side projects that felt like they had to be finished. The highest priority belonged to them, over work, gym, or even relaxing. It has helped to look back and recognize these patterns, however the biggest aid was the finding the right system and tools that work with my neurology, not against it. I've tried a lot and I have found something that works for me now. 

### Overview

Let's get to it. My workflow requires automation and syncing. If a task occupies my mind, it has to be scheduled right away. I cannot rely on myself to remember to water the plants. It needs to be scheduled and rescheduled if I cannot work on it when the scheduled time arrives. As much as I hate the idea of living by a calendar, I have learned that if things need to be done, they need to be timetabled. So this is how I organize my time.

**Personal Calendarc**

This is mainly to track bigger events and dates. Concerts, dinners with friends, movie showings, etc.

**Work Calendar**

All events that I create or am invited to end up on this section of my work calendar.

**Task Tracking: Todoist**

I have been a paying member of Todoist for over 4 years. It's the only app that I have felt actually works for me in the sense that I can be consistent. Both consistent in checking what I need to do and adding things that I need to do. A shortcut is setup on my phone's homescreen where if I swipe from the bottom left, it opens the "Add a New Task" dialogue box and Upcoming Tasks when I swipe from the bottom right. The killer feature is the natural language scheduling. If I want to add a reminder to check up on a reservation, all I need to type is "Check reservation tom 4pm for 30 mins" and both a task and a calendar event (thanks to native Calendar integration) is added on my personal calendar tomorrow at 4:00pm with a duration of 30 minutes. For recurring tasks like watering my plants, I can type in once "Water plants every 2 weeks 5pm for 30 mins" and I am good to go.

**Reclaim.ai**

The final scheduling-related app is called Reclaim.ai, an online service that helps me sync my work life and personal life. Any calendar event during works hours that I create on my personal calendar gets synced to my work calendar as a "Personal Committment" while any work event gets synced to my personal calendar as a "Work Committment." While this seems unnecessary since on your phone, you can most likely see both calendars. It is helpful to keep people informed at work such that I am not booked into meetings at that time. It also helps that I can see what time my personal committments are on my work laptop and vice versa on my personal laptop.

Reclaim also automatically adjusts your calendar in the case of conflicts between habits and events. It might shift my Lunch time by 30 minutes if there's an overlapping between or schedule my 1:1 with my manager on Tuesday instead of Thursday based on both our calendars.

Time Blindness & Task Initiation

Two of my biggest ADHD nemeses are time blindness and task initiation. I struggle with perceiving the passage of time accurately and underestimate how long tasks will take. I also tend to procrastinate endlessly, even for fun or important activities. Getting started feels like climbing Mt. Everest sometimes.

I've tried many timers and calendars, but the tool that has worked best for me is [APP NAME]. [APP NAME] allows me to break down goals and tasks into manageable chunks. I set timed intervals for each step, which helps me stay aware of time passing. The alerts when time is up provide a needed external motivation to transition between tasks. 

I also rely on [APP NAME] to build momentum. I schedule in short approachable tasks to complete as warm ups. Once I get that initial dopamine rush from checking something off, it helps me power through bigger priorities. Having visible progress mapped out keeps me motivated.

[OTHER APP] has also been a game changer for getting unstuck. I use it to block out distractions so I can hyperfocus on the task at hand. [Insert details on how it helps].

Organization & Memory 

My ADHD doesn't do me any favors in the organization and memory departments. Keeping track of papers, appointments, and all life's details can feel overwhelming and futile. I forget things minutes after hearing them.

The tool that's saved my sanity in this realm is [APP NAME]. I use [APP NAME] to maintain a centralized digital system for just about everything. Folders and tags keep me organized. Features like smart search and optical character recognition help me find what I need in seconds. 

I also love the capture tools in [APP NAME] for grabbing thoughts, notes, and other snippets easily so they don't float away. The daily planner provides structure to see upcoming appointments, tasks, and events all in one place. [Insert any other features helpful for you].

Having an external brain to store all my info has reduced so much frustration and anxiety over losing track of things. I can trust that the details are captured somewhere I can access them.

Hyperfocusing 

A common ADHD trait is hyperfocusing - getting so engrossed in an activity that you lose all track of time and forget basic needs like eating. As enjoyable as flow states can be, they aren't always productive.

I use [APP NAME] to help prevent falling into endless hyperfocus rabbit holes. It allows me to block distracting sites and apps for customized periods. I also like the timed focus features for balancing deep work with breaks. 

Besides digital tools, I build in external checks for my hyperfocus tendencies. I set phone alarms to remind myself to take a walk or eat lunch. Having an accountability partner also helps - I run ideas by them to get a second opinion if I'm obsessively pursuing something unproductively. 

The right tools plus self-awareness go a long way in harnessing my hyperfocusing for good instead of letting it control me.

Conclusion:

ADHD certainly poses challenges, but tailored systems make all the difference. The workflows and tools I've outlined - [APP NAME], [APP NAME], [APP NAME] - help me work with my neurology, not against it. I hope my toolkit gives some ideas to others with ADHD looking to optimize their processes. What works for you? Let me know in the comments!
