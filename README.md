> ### A resource for me to put stuff in.

A tiny website made with Svelte that houses my resume, projects, blog posts, etc. Coming soon: interactive MDX-based blog posts!

### Developing

Clone the repository, install dependencies and use the `dev` script. For yarn, this would be `yarn && yarn dev`; for pnpm, we would `pnpm install && pnpm dev`; etc.

### Contributing

Why would you? =) If there's an error in a blog post, feel free to open up a PR though.
